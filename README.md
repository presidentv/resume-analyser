# 🔍 AI Job Fit Evaluator

---

## Introduction

The AI Job Fit Evaluator is a Streamlit application that analyzes resumes against job descriptions to provide insights on job fit, key strengths, potential gaps, and hiring recommendations. This tool leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the recruitment process and offer data-driven evaluations.

## Features

- **Job Description Extraction**: Automatically extracts job details from a provided URL.
- **Resume Parsing**: Extracts text from uploaded PDF resumes using PyMuPDF.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes the Groq LLM to analyze the resume against the job description.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Provides a job fit score, key strengths, potential gaps, and a final recommendation.
